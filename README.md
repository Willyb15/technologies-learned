##OS
###Linux
```
An open-source operating system modelled on UNIX.
Linux is, in simplest terms, an operating system. It is the software on a computer 
that enables applications and the computer operator to access the devices on the computer 
to perform desired functions. The operating system (OS) relays instructions from an application to,
for instance, the computer's processor. The processor performs the instructed task, 
then sends the results back to the application via the operating system.
Explained in these terms, Linux is very similar to other operating systems, such as Windows and OS X.
```
###Unix
```
The UNIX brand has traditionally been applied to the family of multitasking, 
multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T UNIX operating system, 
developed in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by 
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others 
```
### Mac OS

```
##Front-End
###HTML
```
Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve 
font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
```
###CSS/SASS
```
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
of a document written in a markup language.
```
```
Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 
SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes.
```
###JavaScript/jQuery/Angular
```
JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create
interactive effects within web browsers.
```
```
Query is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document 
traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation,
and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
```
```
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your 
template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. 
Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
```
#Back-End
###Apache/Linux
###Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB
```
In software development, Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework, 
many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript.
```
```
Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, 
and hybrid web applications. It is the de facto standard server framework for node.js.
```
###Apache
```
the Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache (/əˈpætʃiː/ ə-pa-chee), is the world's most used web server software. Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server, development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web,[4] quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and has remained most popular since April 1996. In 2009, it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million websites.
